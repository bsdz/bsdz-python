# TSqlParse #

A macro parser for TSQL scripts.

Macros are stored in comments so they do not interfere with other tools such as SSMS. Currently [supported macros](TSqlParseSupportedMacros.md) include command line parameters and format string logging. Future macros might allow inline Python or TSQL.

Command line options can be found [here](TSqlParseOptions.md) and a complete example can be found [here](TSqlParseExample.md).
