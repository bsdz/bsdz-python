# TSqlParse

A macro parser for TSQL scripts.

Macros are stored in comments so they do not interfere with other tools such as SSMS. Currently supported macros include command line parameters and format string logging. Future macros might allow inline Python or TSQL.

Command line options can be found here and a complete example can be found here.
